## Requirements
Python >= 3.9 with the following libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

- graphviz
- xgboost

## How to Run
1. Open `CS4372_Assignment2_LT.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Run all cells in order.

## Assumptions
For the sake of this assignment, I wanted to make sure I could get varied results to explore different tree models. So, 2 features were dropped (Odor and Spore_Print_Color) due to being too strong features for determining the target. 

Despite dropping these two features, I still got perfect results on many of the models, so my results may not effectively highlight the differences between these models.
